                "Charity is no solution to poverty. It may help stop the process
                of pauperisation getting worse. If charity is not used for right
                purpose, it takes away the initiative from the people. Charity
                sometimes helps us to shield ourselves from paying attention to
                the essence of the problem of poverty. It allows us to get ahead
                with our lives without worrying about poor people.s lives. It
                allows our conscience to remain insulated."
